Release Notes for Trilinos Package ForTrilinos 
-----------------------------------------------


Trilinos 10.4.1:
----------------

 (*) This release includes 11 modules or classes of the Epetra package.

 (*) This package is still in its experimental stage and is only supported on AIX.

 (*) Sample configure script are provided in Trilinos/sampleScripts/aix-fortrilinos-serial
     and Trilinos/sampleScripts/aix-fortrilinos-mpif90 for serial and mpi builds respectively.
 
 (*) Because of the object-oriented features used, it requires a XL Fortran compiler v13.1.
     The source code can be compiled using the xlf compiler option.

 (*) Required compiler flags for Fortran include:
       -qfixed=72 -qxlines:   deals with older Fortran source code in other Trilinos packages.
                              These flags are used for mpi builds and must be specified in 
                              the configure script.
       -qxlf2003=polymorphic: allows for the use of polymorphism in the source code.
       -qxlf2003=autorealloc: allows the compiler to automatically reallocate the left hand
                              side with the shape of the right hand side when using allocatable
                              variables in an assignment.
       -qfree=f90:            informs the compiler that the source code is free form and 
                              conforms to Fortran 90.

     These flags(-qfree=f90 -qxlf2003=polymorphic -qxlf2003=autorealloc) are hardcoded
     in Trilinos/packages/ForTrilinos/CMakeLists.txt

 (*) Required compiler flag for xlc++ include:
       -qrtti=all:            this flag should be included in the configure script.

 (*) The project is primarily user-driven; so new interfaces are developed at the request of Trilinos users.
