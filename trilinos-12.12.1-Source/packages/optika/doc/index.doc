\section Optika_intro Introduction 
The Optika package is intended to give Trilinos Developers an 
easy way to construct a GUI for their program. Through the use of Teuchos ParameterLists,
the Optika package will allow the developer to achieve the following
work flow within their program:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Specify a list of inputs needed from the user
	\item Define valid values for inputs as well as defaults
	\item Present the required inputs to the user in the form of a GUI
	\item Allow the user to change the values of the inputs to their liking
	\item Obtain the values the user entered in the form of a Parameter List.
	\end{enumerate}

\section Compile Notes
In order to compile Optika you must have Qt installed. You can either download Qt directly from the website (http://qt.nokia.com)
or if you are on Linux, you can use your package manager (this is highly recommended). If you use your package manager, make sure you 
download the Qt development package (usually something like qt4-devel) and that it is Qt version 4.5 or higher. If you download Qt 
directly and put it some where other than the default installation directory, the simplest way to ensure that optika finds it 
is by setting the configure option TPL_QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE to the location of your qmake executable. For example, if I had installed 
qt to my home directory in the directory qt4.6 then I would use the following in my configuration of Trilinos:

<code>
-DTPL_QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH="/home/kurtis/qt4.6/bin/qmake"
</code>

You can also put the path to the qmake executable in your $PATH variable.
For example, lets assume that I installed qt to a directory in my home directory called qt4.6, then I would issue the following command:

For BASH:

<code>
$  export $PATH=/home/kurtis/qt4.6/bin:$PATH
</code>

For TSCH:

<code>
$  set path=( /home/kurtis/qt4.6/bin $path)
</code>

To permanently set the $PATH variable so it always includes the path to the qmake executable, I could put the previous commands into the
.bash_profile or .cshrc files respectively.

You can browse all of Optika as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning, this is not the recommended way to learn
about Optika software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of optika</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.
