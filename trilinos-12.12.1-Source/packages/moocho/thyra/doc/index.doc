/*! \mainpage MOOCHO/Thyra Adapter Software

This doxygen collection documents a set of code that allows MOOCHO to solve
optimization problems presented as <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> and objects.

There are several different categories of adapter software here:

<ul>

<li><b>AbstractLinAlgPack</b> Adapters: This is software that adapts objects
supporting the fundamental Thyra ANA operator/vector interfaces and uses them
to implement the equivalent abstractions in AbstractLinAlgPack.

<b>Warning!</b> This software is likely to be changed radically, and perhaps
eliminated all together, if and when MOOCHO is refactored to directly use
Thyra abstractions.

<li><b>NLPInterfacePack</b> Adapters: This software adapts
<tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> objects to implement NLP objects.

  <ul>

  <li><tt>NLPInterfacePack::NLPDirectThyraModelEvaluator</tt> adapts a
  <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> object to create an
  <tt>NLPInterfacePack::NLPDirect</tt> object to support
  direct-sensitivity optimization algorithms.

  <li><tt>NLPInterfacePack::NLPFirstOrderThyraModelEvaluator</tt> adapts a
  <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> object to create an
  <tt>NLPInterfacePack::NLPFirstOrder</tt> object to support
  adjoint-sensitivity (and direct sensitivity) optimization algorithms.

  </ul>

<b>Warning!</b> This software is likely to be changed radically if and when
NLPInterfacePack is refactored to support a more
<tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> type of interface.

<li><b>MoochoPack</b> Adapters: This software provides facade (see "Design
Patterns" book) wrapper(s) for <tt>MoochoPack</tt> software to provide extra
functionality for solving NLPs expressed as <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt>
objects.

  <ul>

  <li><tt>MoochoPack::MoochoThyraSolver</tt> provides a facade around
  <tt>MoochoPack::MoochoSolver</tt> that allows clients to very easily
  solve NLPs expressed as <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> objects.  Note
  that Stratimikos should also be used in addition to this class to
  provide linear solver capability.

  </ul>

</ul>
