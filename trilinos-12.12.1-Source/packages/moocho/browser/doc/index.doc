/*! \mainpage MOOCHO : Doxygen Browser Collection for all of MOOCHO

The purpose of this doxygen documentation collection is to allow experienced
developers a quick and easy way to browse all of the MOOCHO package in a
single doxygen documentation collection.  Most people are better off starting
at the <a href="../../../doc/html/index.html">main MOOCHO documentation
page</a> since this is where one will find examples and tutorials.

<b>Warning!</b> If you become overwhelmed by clicking on the above links
(i.e. "Class Hierarchy", "Class List", "File List" etc.) then you would be
wise to go back to the <a href="../../../doc/html/index.html">main MOOCHO
documentation page</a>.
